# Introduction
Hello!

This repository is a collection of portfolio projects from courses in my Computer Science Post-Bacc with Oregon State University. Consider it a ***learning*** repo: as I look back over these projects, there is not very much code that I wouldn't now refactor into something more clean or robust if I were to redo it! Though at this point I'd prefer to pursue new projects fresh rather than revisit all of my old assignments, this collection does offer a small glimpse into the tools, languages, frameworks and concepts I have tackled during my program. I present it here as a reference for potential employers.

To connect with me please send an e-mail to [phillitr@oregonstate.edu](mailto:phillitr@oregonstate.edu). I look forward to hearing from you. Have a wonderful day!
